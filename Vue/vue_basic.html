    <h2>Useful Features of Vue</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Vue can bind JavaScript variables to the DOM, so that if the user updates the DOM (e.g. by entering a value into a form field), the value is automatically stored in a JavaScript variable. Likewise, if you modify a JavaScript variable (e.g. showing a list of products for a product search), this will automatically update the DOM if you bind it to an element such as a div tag.</li>
        <li>Vue is component-based, so that you can build a component for a single feature (such as login form) and that component includes all of the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in a single file of your code. This means that if a part of your page is not working properly, you know exactly where to go to fix it. This also makes it easy to reuse components across different web pages.</li>
        <li>Vue has a shallow learning curve, meaning it is easy to pick up the basics and get started right away. The core components of Vue work to make a single web page in an application. You can then add the Vue Router to create web applications with multiple pages and Vuex to store data in large applications.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Vue</h1>
    <h2>Useful Features of Vue</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Vue can bind JavaScript variables to the DOM, so that if the user updates the DOM (e.g. by entering a value into a form field), the value is automatically stored in a JavaScript variable. Likewise, if you modify a JavaScript variable (e.g. showing a list of products for a product search), this will automatically update the DOM if you bind it to an element such as a div tag.</li>
        <li>Vue is component-based, so that you can build a component for a single feature (such as login form) and that component includes all of the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in a single file of your code. This means that if a part of your page is not working properly, you know exactly where to go to fix it. This also makes it easy to reuse components across different web pages.</li>
        <li>Vue has a shallow learning curve, meaning it is easy to pick up the basics and get started right away. The core components of Vue work to make a single web page in an application. You can then add the Vue Router to create web applications with multiple pages and Vuex to store data in large applications.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Two core features of Vue</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Declarative Rendering</li>
        <p>Vue extends standard HTML with a template syntax that allows us to declaratively describe HTML output based on JavaScript state.</p>
        <li>Reactivity</li>
        <p>Vue automatically tracks JavaScript state changes and efficiently updates the DOM when changes happen.</p>
    </ul>
    

    <h2>How can Vue be used...</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Enhancing static HTML without a build step</li>
        <li>Embedding as Web Components on any page</li>
        <li>Single-Page Application (SPA)</li>
        <li>Fullstack / Server-Side-Rendering (SSR)</li>
        <li>JAMStack / Static-Site-Generation (SSG)</li>
        <li>Targeting desktop, mobile, WebGL or even the terminal</li>        
    </ul>

    <h2>API Styles</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Options API</li>
        <p>With Options API, we define a component's logic using an object of options such as data, methods, and mounted. Properties defined by options are exposed on this inside functions, which points to the component instance.</p>
        <li>Composition API</li>
    </ul>

<h1>Main Activity</h1>
<h2>AppCompatActivity</h2>
<p>subclass of Android's Activity class that provides compatibility support for older versions of Android.</p>

<h2>onCreate</h2>
<p>it called when an instance of the activity subclass is created</p>
<p>You can link the activity to its UI by using <br>
Activity.setContentView(layoutResID: Int).<br>
This function inflates a layout and puts it onscreen. <br>
When a layout is inflated, each widget in the layout file is instantiated as defined by its attributes.<br>
You specify which layout to inflate by passing in the layout's resource ID.</p>
<br>
<h2>Resources and Resource IDs</h2>
<p>Layout is a resource. A resource is a piece of your application that is not code thing like image files, audio files, and XML files.<br>
Resources for your project live in a subdirectory of the app/res directory. <br>
To access a resource in code, you use its resource ID.<br>
The resource ID for your layout is R.layout.activity_main</p>
<br>
<h3>R</h3>
<p> R is the place where stores all of the resource ID for the entire layout and for each string.<br>
However, it does not generate resource IDs for the individual widges in activity_main.xml<br>
</p>
<h3>To generate resource ID</h3>
<p>you include an android:id= "@+id/true_button" <br>
There is a +sign for android:id but not in the values for android:text.<br>
This is because you are creating the resource IDs and only referencing the strings</p>

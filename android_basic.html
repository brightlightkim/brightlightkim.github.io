    <h1>My First Android Application</h1>
    <p>
        An activity is an instance of <b>Activity</b><br>
        You write subclasses of <b>Activity</b> to implement functionality that your app requires<br>
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>MainActivity</h3>
    <p>This is the part to link between Layout to View Objects<br>
    </p>
    <h3>Layout - XML</h3>
    <h4>activity_main.xml </h4>
    <p>the part to define widgets.<br></p>
    <h5>strings.xml</h5>
    <p>for string variable.<br>
    ex: &lt;string name = "app_name"&gt;GeoQuiz&lt;/string&gt;</p>

    <h3>View Objects</h3>
    <p>Views are the building blocks to compose a UI<br>
        Everything on the screen is a view. Views that the user can see or interact with are called widgets.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Every widget is an instance of the View class or one of its subclasses (such as <b>TextView or Button</b>)</p>
    <br>
    <h5>View Group</h5>
    <p>ViewGroup is a kind of View that contains and arranges other views.<br>
        ViewGroup does not display content itself. ViewGroups are often referred to as layouts.<br>
        In the Default activity layout, <b>ConstraintLayout</b> is the <b>ViewGroup</b> responsible for laying out its
        sole child, a <b>TextView</b> widget<br>
        LinearLayout inherits from <b>ViewGroup</b>. Other ones include FrameLayout as well.<br>
    <ul>
        <li>android:layout_width >> for width</li>
        <li>android:layout_height >> for height</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>match_parent >> big as parent</li>
        <li>wrap_content >> big as its content require</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>andoird:orientation >> can determine if it is vertical or horizontal</li>
        <li>andoird:text >> what text to display. it can reference such as <b>@string/syntax</b></li>
    </ul>
    </p>

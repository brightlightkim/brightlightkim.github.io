<h1>Create a Class</h1>
<h2>Annotation</h2>
<ul>
    <li>It helps the code inspector built into Android Studio verify at compile time that usages of the constructor provide a valid string resource ID. It prevents runtime crashes where the constructor is used with an invalid resource ID</li>
    <li>The annotation makes your code more readable for other developers</li>
</ul>

<br>

<h2>Diagram</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Model (ex: Question class)</li>
    <li>Controller (ex: MainActivity)</li>
    <li>View (ex: layout) </li>
</ul>
<br>

<h1>Model-View-Controller(MVC) and Android </h1>
<p>All objects in your application must be a model object, a view object, or a controller object.</p>
<br>

<h2>Model Object</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Hold the application's data and "business logic."</li>
    <li>It was designed to model the things in your app is concerned with. ex: user, product in a store, a photo on a server, a television show.</li>
    <li>No knowledge of the UI</li>
    <li>Sole Purpose: holding and maintaining data</li>
    <li>Generally custom classes you create.</li>
    <li>All of the model objects in your application compose its model layer.</li>
</ul>
<br>

<h2>View Object</h2>
<ul>
    <li>know how to draw themselvews on the screen and how to respond to user input, like touches</li>
    <li>If you can see it on the screen, then it is a view</li>
    <li>Android provides various configurable view classes.</li>
    <li>You can create your custom view classes.</li>
    <li>An application's view objects make up its view layer.</li>
    <li>ex: res/layout/activity_main.xml</li>
</ul>

<h2>Controller Objects</h2>
<ul>
    <li>tie the view and model objects together.</li>
    <li>contain "application logic."</li>
    <li>respond to various events triggered by view objects</li> 
    <li>manage the flow of data to and from model objects and the veiw layer.</li>
    <li>In Android, a controller is typically a subclass of Activity or Fragment.</li>
    <li>ex: MainActivity</li>
</ul>


<h2>MVC Flow with user input</h2>
<p>User Input >> (User interacts with view object) >> Views >> (View sends message to controller) >> Controller >> (Controller updates model Objects) >> Model</p><br>

<p> Model >> (COntroller takes data from model objects that its views are interested in) >> Controller >> (Controller updates view with changes in model objects) >> Views</p>
<br>

<h2>Advantages of using MVC</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Helps with designing and understanding the application as a whole</li>
    <li>makes classes easier to reuse</li>
</ul>

<h3>Details on the Project</h3>
<br>

<h4>removing the android:text attribute and use tools:text instead</h4>
<p>This will set the question text dynamically as the user clicks through the questions.</p>
<p>It also specify the default string. This indicates clearly that this text is for preview purposes only.</p>
<br>

<h4>Adding an Icon</h4>
<ul>
    <li>mdpi: medium-density screens (~160dpi)</li>
    <li>hdpi: high-density screens (~240dpi)</li>
    <li>xhdpi: extra-high-density screens (~320dpi)</li>
    <li>xxhdpi: extra-extra-high-density screens (~480dpi)</li>
    <li>xxxhdpi: extra-extra-extra-high-density screens (~640dpi)</li>
</ul>

<p>When you add img, png, jpg, or gif, the res folder will be automatically assigned a resource ID.<br>
the filenames must be lowercase and have no spaces.<br><br>

To use this resource, all you have to do is using this resource ID in your code.</p>

<h5>Referencing Resources in XML</h5>
<p>You can add two attributes to the Button widget definition in the activity_main.xml.<br>
ex: android:drawableEnd = "@drawable/arrow_right"<br>
ex: android:drawablePadding = "4dp"<br></p>

<h5>Screen Pixel Densities</h5>
<p>Text Size is the pixel height of the text on the device's screen.<br>
Margins specify the distances betwen views, adn padding specifies the distance between a view's outside edges and its content.</p>
<br>
<ul>
    <li>px: for pixel for one onscreen pixel. Since all the device's dimention is different, it's not recommended.</li>
    <li>dp: short for density-independent pixel. "dip" One dp is always 1/160 of an inch on a device's screen. You get the same size regardless of screen density.</li>
    <li>sp: short for scale-independent pixel. sp are density-independent pixels that also take into account the user's font size preference. You will almost always use sp to set display text size.</li>
    <li>pt, mm, in: These are scaled units, like dp, that allow you to specify interface sizes in points, millimeters, or inches. Not all devices are correctly configured for these units to scale correctly.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will use dp and sp almost exclusively. </p>
<br>

<h5>ImageButton</h5>
<p>You can use image button to use only the resource image.  </p>

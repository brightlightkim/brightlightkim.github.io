        <h2>What is Fragment?</h2>
        <p>
            Fragment is a controller object that an activity can deputize to
            perform tasks.<br>
            Most commonly the task is managing a UI<br>
            UI can be an entire screen or just one part of the screen <br>
            Fragment managing a UI is known as a UI fragment.<br>
            Activity's view can hold a container for the fragment. <br>
            The fragment's view is inserted into the container once it is
            inflated.<br>
            An activity can have multiple containers in its view for different
            fragments<br>

        <h1>Basic Fragment Info</h1>
        <p>
            Fragment layout can be created with onCreateView Functions
            <br> Android supports creating Fragment wih its layout and ViewModel
            at the same time<br>
            onStart is good for setting the functions for "Changed" Listners.
            <br>
            View view = inflater.inflate(R.layout.fragment_crime, container,
            false);
            <br>
            This is the part good for setting it by finding. ex: view.findViewById(R.id.whatid);
            <br>
            Fragment cannot be inflated by itself. It needs activity.

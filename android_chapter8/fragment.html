        <h2>What is Fragment?</h2>
        <p>
            Fragment is a controller object that an activity can deputize to perform tasks.<br>
            Most commonly the task is managing a UI<br>
            UI can be an entire screen or just one part of the screen <br>
            Fragment managing a UI is known as a UI fragment.<br>
            Activity's view can hold a container for the fragment. <br>
            The fragment's view is inserted into the container once it is inflated.<br>
            An activity can have multiple containers in its view for different fragments<br>

<h1>Java Threads</h1>

<h2>What are Threads in Java?</h2>
<p>
    Multithreading can run concurrently.
</p>

<h2>The Java Thread Model</h2>
<ul>
    <li>New - When we create an instance of Thread class, a thread is in a new State</li>
    <li>Runnable - The Java thread is in running state</li>
    <li>Suspended - A running thread can be suspended, which temporarily suspends its activity. A suspended thread can then be resumed, allowing it to pick up where it left off.</li>
    <li>Blocked - A java thread can be locked when waiting for a resource.</li>
    <li>Terminated - A thread can be terminated, which halts its execution immediately at any given time. Once a thread is terminated, it cannot be resumed.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Multithreading in Java</h2>
<p>Thread Class, its methods, and its companion interface, Runnable
    <br>
    To create a new thread, your program will either extend Thread or implement the Runnable interface.
    <br>
    The thread has following methods.
</p>

<h2>Main Java Thread</h2>
<h3>What this matter?</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Because this thread effects the other ‘child’ threads</li>
    <li>Because it performs various shutdown actions</li>
    <li>It is created automatically when your program is started.</li>
</ul>
<h3>How to Create a Java Thread?</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Implementing the Runnable Interface</li>
    <li>By extending the Thread</li>
</ul>
<h3>Runnable Interface</h3>
<p>The easiest way. <br>
    Example:<br>
    public class myClass implements Runnable {<br>
        public void run(){<br>
            System.out.println("MyClass running");<br>
        } <br>
    } <br>
<br>
    Thread t1 = new Thread(new MyClass()); <br>
    t1.start(); <br>
    <br>
    When the thread started it will call the run() method.
</p>
<p>Second Way: Extending Java Thread <br>
Example: <br> <br>
public class MyClass extends Thread { <br>
     public void run(){ <br>
     System.out.println("MyClass running"); <br>
   } <br>
} <br>
How to use it? <br>
MyClass t1 = new MyClass (); <br>
T1.start(); <br>
</p>
<h2>How to Create a Java Thread?</h2>
<p>
class MyThread implements Runnable { <br>
String name; <br>
Thread t; <br>
    MyThread (String thread){ <br>
    name = threadname; <br>
    t = new Thread(this, name); <br>
System.out.println("New thread: " + t);<br>
t.start();<br>
}<br>
 <br>
 <br>
public void run() {<br>
 try {<br>
     for(int i = 5; i > 0; i--) {<br>
     System.out.println(name + ": " + i);<br>
      Thread.sleep(1000);<br>
}<br>
}catch (InterruptedException e) {<br>
     System.out.println(name + "Interrupted");<br>
}<br>
     System.out.println(name + " exiting.");<br>
}<br>
}<br>
 
class MultiThread {<br>
public static void main(String args[]) {<br>
     new MyThread("One");<br>
     new MyThread("Two");<br>
     new NewThread("Three");<br>
try {<br>
     Thread.sleep(10000);<br>
} catch (InterruptedException e) {<br>
      System.out.println("Main thread Interrupted");<br>
}<br>
      System.out.println("Main thread exiting.");<br>
      }<br>
}</p>

<h1>UI Thread</h1>
<p>
    Everything happen with UI widgets >> execute codes with this. <br>
    Various threads. <br>
    Event to happen immediately. <br>
    Don't evecute something really big. <br>
    Access internet should not happen with UI Thread. <br>
    If the file is too small (exception) <br>
</p>

<h2>Android UI Thread</h2>
<p>Internet >> Throw exception. <br>
    Don't make a UI Thread. 
</p>

<h2>Background Thread</h2>
<p>
    AsyncTask is the old way of doing stuff. <br>
    java.util.concurrent package is the preferred way of doing it. <br>
    - Uses an ExecutorServie to execute the thread. <br>
    - requires integration with the Android UI thread. <br>
    <br>
</p>

<h3>Runnable vs Callable</h3>
<ul>
    <li></li>
</ul>
<p>
Write a class that implements the Runnable interface <br>
    ■ Your code goes in the public void run()method <br>
    ■ Preferred when you don’t need to return a result <br>
    ■ Most Cases: Use Runnable >> In this class only this. <br>
<br>
Write a class that implements the Callable<V> interface <br>
    ■ Your code goes in the public V call()method <br>
    ■ Preferred when you need to return a result <br>
<br>
</p>

<h3>Integrate a background thread with the Android UI Thread.</h3>
<p>
    1. Create an android.os.Handler class that can process messages sent from the background thread <br>
        - Create it from the UI (main) thread or exp;licitly connect it tot he UI thread <br>
        - Write code in it's 'handleMessage' method to interact with the UI. <br>
    <br>
    2. Create a Runnable class for the background task. <br>
        - Pass the Handler to the Runnable Class <br>
        - Include the code you want to execute in the run method <br> 
    <br>
    3. Create an ExecutorService and submit the Runnable class to it to cause it to execute in a background thread <br>
    <br>

</p>
<br>

<h3>Example of android.os.Handler Class</h3>

<br>
<h3>Create a Runnable Class</h3>
<img src="./runnable.PNG" alt="">
<br>

<h3>ExecutorService</h3>
<p>
    ExecutorService executor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();<br>
    executor.submit(task); <br>    
</p>
<br>

<h3>required Android Permissions</h3>
<p>
    you must specify permissions in the AndroidManifest.xml file. <br>
    <uses-permission android:name=""android.permission.INTERNET"/> <br>
    Also required on Android OS 9 or later: <br>
    <application android:usesCleartextTraffic="true">

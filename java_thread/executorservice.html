<h1>Executor Service</h1>
<p>
    ExecutorService is a JDK API that simplifies running tasks in asynchronous mode
<br>Generally speaking, ExecutorService automatically provides a pool of threads and an API for assigning tasks to it.
</p>
<h2>Instantiating ExecutorService</h2>
<p>
    example: <br>
    ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(10); <br>
    - This is to create a thread pool with 10 threads. <br>

</p>

<h2>Directly Create an ExecutorService</h2>
<p>
    example: <br>
    ExecutorService executorService = <br>
  new ThreadPoolExecutor(1, 1, 0L, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS,  <br> 
  new LinkedBlockingQueue<Runnable>()); <br>
</p>
<br>
<h2>Assigning Tasks to the ExecutorService</h2>
<p>
    Runnable runnableTask = () -> {
    try {
        TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS.sleep(300);
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
};

Callable<String> callableTask = () -> {
    TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS.sleep(300);
    return "Task's execution";
};

List<Callable<String>> callableTasks = new ArrayList<>();
callableTasks.add(callableTask);
callableTasks.add(callableTask);
callableTasks.add(callableTask);
<br>
We can assign tasks to the ExecutorService using several methods including execute(), which is inherited from the Executor interface, and also submit(), invokeAny() and invokeAll(). <br>
<br>
The execute() method is void and doesn't give any possibility to get the result of a task's execution or to check the task's status (is it running): <br>
<br>
executorService.execute(runnableTask); <br>
<br>
submit() submits a Callable or a Runnable task to an ExecutorService and returns a result of type Future:
<br>
Future<String> future = 
  executorService.submit(callableTask); <br>
<br>
invokeAny() assigns a collection of tasks to an ExecutorService, causing each to run, and returns the result of a successful execution of one task (if there was a successful execution): <br>
Example: String result = executorService.invokeAny(callableTasks); <br>
<br>
invokeAll() assigns a collection of tasks to an ExecutorService, causing each to run, and returns the result of all task executions in the form of a list of objects of type Future: <br>
List<Future<String>> futures = executorService.invokeAll(callableTasks); <br>
<br>
</p>

<h2>4. Shutting Down an ExecutorService</h2>
<p>
    The shutdown() method doesn't cause immediate destruction of the ExecutorService. It will make the ExecutorService stop accepting new tasks and shut down after all running threads finish their current work: <br>
    executorService.shutdown(); <br>
    <br>
    The shutdownNow() method tries to destroy the ExecutorService immediately, but it doesn't guarantee that all the running threads will be stopped at the same time: <br>
    List<Runnable> notExecutedTasks = executorService.shutDownNow(); <br>
    <br>
    One good way to shut down the ExecutorService (which is also recommended by Oracle) is to use both of these methods combined with the awaitTermination() method: <br>
    executorService.shutdown();
try {
    if (!executorService.awaitTermination(800, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)) {
        executorService.shutdownNow();
    } 
} catch (InterruptedException e) {
    executorService.shutdownNow();
}
<br>
</p>

<h2>The Future Interface</h2>
<p>
    The submit() and invokeAll() methods return an object or a collection of objects of type Future, which allows us to get the result of a task's execution or to check the task's status (is it running).
<br>
The Future interface provides a special blocking method get(), which returns an actual result of the Callable task's execution or null in the case of a Runnable task: <br>

    Future<String> future = executorService.submit(callableTask);
String result = null;
try {
    result = future.get();
} catch (InterruptedException | ExecutionException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
<br>
Calling the get() method while the task is still running will cause execution to block until the task properly executes and the result is available. <br>
String result = future.get(200, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS); <br>
<br>
We can use the isDone() method to check if the assigned task already processed or not. <br>
boolean canceled = future.cancel(true); <br>
boolean isCancelled = future.isCancelled(); <br>

        <h1>ActivityOptions</h1>
        <p>This is the part to create the animation.
            <br>
            Example: <br>
            cheatButton.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {<br>
            @Override<br>
            public void onClick(View view) {<br>
                // Start CheatActivity<br>
                boolean answerIsTrue = <br>
                            getQuizViewModel().getCurrentQuestionAnswer();<br>
                Intent intent = CheatActivity.newIntent(MainActivity.this,<br>
                                                        answerIsTrue);<br>
                ActivityOptions options = <br>
                    ActivityOptions.makeClipRevealAnimation(<br>
                        view, 0, 0, view.getWidth(), view.getHeight());<br>
							
                startActivityForResult(intent, REQUEST_CODE_CHEAT,<br>
                                       options.toBundle());<br>
            }<br>
        });<br>

        </p>
        <h2>Better Approach</h2>
        <p>
            Add @SuppressLint("RestrictedApi")<br>
            <br>
            if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= Build.VERSION_CODES.M) {<br>
                    ActivityOptions options = <br>
                        ActivityOptions.makeClipRevealAnimation(<br>
                            view, 0, 0, view.getWidth(), view.getHeight());<br>
                    startActivityForResult(intent, REQUEST_CODE_CHEAT, <br>
                                           options.toBundle());<br>
                } else {<br>
                    startActivityForResult(intent, REQUEST_CODE_CHEAT);<br>
                }<br>
            
            @This is the way to handle the compatibility
        </p>

        <h1>Jetpack Libraries</h1>
        <p>
            Guarding API is not the optimal<br>
            1. It's more work for me as a developer.<br>
            2. It means that users of your app will have a different experience based on the version their device is running<br>
            <br>
            Jetpack Libaries offer new features (like ViewModel), backward compatibility for new features on older devices and provide consistent behavior when possible across Android versions.<br>
            It allows you to write a few conditional API checks as possible.<br>
            <br>

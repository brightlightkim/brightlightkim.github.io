    <h2>Nonexistent</h2>
    <p>represents an activity that has not been lauched yet or an activity that was just destroyed.<br>
        this state is sometimes referred to as the "destroyed" state.<br>
        There is no instance in memory and there is no associated view for the user to see or interact with.<br>
    </p>

    <h2>Stopped</h2>
    <p>has an instance in memory but whose view is not visible on the screen.<br>
        occurs in passing when the activity is first spinning up and re-occurs any time the view is fully stopped.<br>
    </p>
    <br>

    <h2>Paused</h2>
    <p>
        not active in the foreground but whose view is visible or partially visible.<br>
        An activity would be partically visible<br>
        ex:if the user lauched a new dialog-themed or transparent activity on top of it.<br>
        An activity could also be fully visible but not in the foreground if the user is viewing two activities in
        multi-window mode.<br>
    </p>

    <h2>Resuemed</h2>
    <p>
        in memory, fully visible, and in the foreground.<br>
        It is the activity the user is currently interacting with. <br>
        Only one activity across the entire system can be resumed state at any given time.<br>
        That means that if one activity is moving into the resumed state,another is likely moving out of the resumed
        state.<br>
    </p>

    <h2>Lifecycle Callbacks</h2>
    <h3>onCreate(Bundle?)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>inflating widgets and putting them on screen (in the call to setContentView(Int))</li>
        <li>getting references to inflated widgets</li>
        <li>setting listeners on widgets to handle user interaction</li>
        <li>connecting to external model data</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We simply override the callbacks in your activity subclass</p>

    <h2>Logging the Activity LifeCycle</h2>
    <p>
        In Andoird, the android.util.Log class sends log messages to a shared system-level log<br>
        Log has several functions for logging messages.<br>
        public static int d(String tag, String msg)<br>
        d stands for debug.<br>
        1st parameter: source of the message.<br>
        2nd parameter: contents of the message<br>
    </p>

    <h2>FrameLayout</h2>
    <p>
        simplest ViewGroup and does not arrange its children in any particular manner.<br>
        In this layout, child views will be arranged according to their andorid:layout_gravity attributes.<br>
        This is why you added android:layout_gravity to TextView, LinearLayout, and Button.<br>
        The Button children of teh nested LinearLayout can stay exactly the same since they are not direct children of the FrameLayout.<br>

    </p>

    <h3>How to fix the stop problem during the multi-window system</h3>
    <p>
        Move playback resuming and pasuing to onStart() and onStop().<br>
        This goes for any live-updating data, like a photo gallery app<br>
        In short, your activities should update the UI during their entire visible lifecycle from onStart() to onStop().<br>
    </p>

    <h3>Log</h3>

        <tr>
            <th>Log Level</th>

    <ul>
        <li>one that takes a TAG string and a message string</li>
        <li>one that takes those two arguments plus an instnace of Throwable</li>
    </ul>

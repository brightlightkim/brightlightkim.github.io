    <h1>Persisting UI State</h1>

    <h2>ViewModel</h2>
    <p>Comes from an Android Jetpack library called lifecycle-extensions.<br>
        This is one of many libraries that you will use throughout this book. <br>
        The first thing to do is to add dependencies.<br>
    </p>
    <h3>Basic View Model</h3>
    <p>on?Cleared() function is called just before a ViewModel is destroeyd.</p>
    <P>The ViewModelProviders class (note the plural “Providers”) provides instances of the ViewModelProvider class.
        <br> If you get stuck finding the ViewModelProviders class, you should do the implementation in the build
        gradle(app)<br>
        as "implementation ........"
    </P>
    <br>

    <h4>ViewModelPorviders Class</h4>
    <p>- Provides instances of the ViewModelProvider class. <br>
        ViewModelProvider.of(this) creates and returns a ViewModelProvider associated with the activity.<br>
    </p>

    <h4>ViewModelProvider Class</h4>
    <p>provides instances of ViewModel to the activity. Calling provider.get(QuizViewModel::class.java) returns an
        instance of QuizViewModel.<br>
        ex: ViewModelProvides.of(this).get(QuizViewModel::class.java)<br>
        ViewModelProvider class acts like a registry of ViewModels. <br>
        When the activity queries for a QuizViewModel for the first time, ViewModelProvider creates and returns a new
        QuizViewModel instance.<br>
        When the activity queries for the QuizViewModel after a configuration change, the instance that was first
        created is returned. <br>
        When the activity is finished (such as when the user presses the back button), the ViewModel-Activity pair is
        removed from memory.<br>
    </p>

    <h3>ViewModel Lifecyle and ViewModelProvider</h3>
    <p>
        Activities: resumed, paused, stopped, and nonexistent.
        When the user finishes an activity, they expect their UI state to be reset. When the user rotates an activity,
        they expect their UI state to be the same before and after rotation.<br>
        <br>

        You can check two scenarios by checking the activitiey's isFinishing property.<br>
        If (isFinishing == true){<br>
        //destoryed because the user finished the activity.<br>
        }<br>
        else{<br>
        being destoryed by the system because of a configuration change.<br>
        }<br>
        <br>
        There is a better way >> ViewModel does the tracking isfinishing and preserve UI state.<br>

        ViewModel's lifecycle more closely mirrors the user's expectations. is destroyed only when its associated
        activity is finished.<br>

        ViewModel >> with activity's lifecycle >>scoped to that activity's lifecycle. >> ViewModel remain in memory
        regardless of the activity's state, until the activity is finished.<br>

        Once the activity is finished, the ViewModel instance is destroyed.<br>

        (Cautions)<br>
        - ViewModel should never hold a reference to an activity or a view, otherwise you will introduce a memory
        leak.<br>
        <br>

        If the ViewModel tried to update the view oof the stale activity, it would trigger an illegalStateException.<br>

    </p>

    <h3>Add data to your ViewModel</h3>
    <p>
        If we put data into the ViewModel, it will survive the rotation.<br>
    </p>

    <h2>Saving Data Across Process Death</h2>
    <p>
        There are other times that OS can destroy an activity even though the user does not intend it to.<br>
        How can you save UI state data and use it to reconstruct the activity?
    </p>

    <h3>Saved Instance State</h3>
    <p>
        Saved INstance State is data the Os teporarily stores outside of the activity.<bR>
        You can add values to saed instance state by overriding Activity.onSaveInstanceState(Bundle).<br>
        The OS calls Activity.onSaveInstanceState(Bundle) any time an activity that is not finished moves to the stopped
        state (when the user presses the Home button and then launches a different app.)<br>
        This timing is important because stopped activities are marked as killable. <bR>
        Activity.onSaveInstanceState(Bundle) was already called when app process is killed.<br>

    </p>
    <h4>Overrideing onSaveInstanceState(Bundle)</h4>
    <p>
        add a constant that will be the key for the key-value pair that will be stored in the bundle.<br>
        override onSaveInstanceState(Bundle) to write the value of currentIndex to the bundle with the constant as its
        key.<br>
    </p>
    <h3>Bundle</h3>
    <p>a structure that maps string keys to values of certain limited types.</p>


    <h2>Gradle</h2>
    <p>Allows for the specification of new dependencies.<br>
        Gradle will find, download, and include the dependencies for you during the compile.<br>
        onCreate accepts a nullable bundle as input. >> there is no state when a new instance of the activity is
        launched by the user the first time. So in this case the bundle would be null. <br>
        When the activity is re-created after roatation or process death, the bundle object will be non-null.<br>

    </p>

    <h2>ViewModel vs onSaveInstanceState</h2>
    <h3>ViewModel</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>shines when you use it to orchestrate dynamic data for the activity</li>
        <li>make scontinuing a download operation across a configuration change simple.</li>
        <li>Offers an easy way to keep data that was expensive to load in memory across a configuration change.</li>
        <li>gets cleaned up automatically once the user finishes the activity.</li>
        <li>not shine int the process death scenario since it gets wiped away from memory along with the process and
            everything in it.</li>
        <li>onSaveInstanceState has its own limitations >> serialized to desk >> should avoid stashing any large or
            complex objets.</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Solutions</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Use onSaveInstanceState to store the minimal amount of information necessary to recreate the UI state.</li>
        <li>Use ViewMoel to cache the rich set of data needed to populate the UI in memory across configuration changes
            for quick and easy access.</li>
        <li>When the activity is re-created after process death, use the saved instance state infromation to set up the
            ViewModel as if the ViewModel and activity were never desroyed.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How to solve with the redundant work?</h3>
    <p>
        make ViewModel a little smarter.
        first check whether the data is fresh before doing the work to pull in and update the rest of the data.
        <br>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Shared preferences: fine for very simple and small data</li>
        <li>Local Database: beter option for larger, more complex data.</li>
    </ul>
